/**
 * Styles for fixing the off-canvas dialog and Layout Builder.
 *
 * There are various incompatibilities with Bootstrap and the USWDS.  The
 * dialog has issues that are caused by Bootstrap's modal styles.  Layout
 * Builder also provides a lot of its own styles, which override those that
 * are provided by the base theme - including at least one 508 style.  So some
 * of the fixes are here to override Layout Builder's overrides and provide
 * the styles we need.
