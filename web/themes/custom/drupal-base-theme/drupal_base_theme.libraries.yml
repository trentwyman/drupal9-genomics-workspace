    # The button.js was preventing Drupal modals from working properly.  I
    # disabled rather than removing it entirely in case it's ever needed.  It
    # shouldn't be re-enabled without thorough testing.  If it's needed, then
    # try to include it in a separate library that can be attached to specific
    # pages that require it, avoiding the conflict with modal dialogs.
